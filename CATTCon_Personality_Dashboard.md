##### The description of each personality dimension is at the bottom of this page. *NonConformity* appears to be least important in this sample and has limited variability around the center of this scale.

## Personality Traits and Experience Correlations

##### Data analysis determined several moderate correlations (0.3 - 0.5) between behavioral traits and years of experience.

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Positive Correlations with Years of Experience

  - *Self-Efficacy*: belief in one’s own ability to deal with a
    prospective situation in cybersecurity roles.
  - *SelfConfidence*: Someone who would be unafraid to pursue a
    resolution when he/she uncovers a questionable activity.
  - *SelfDetermining*: Taking a step back from an issue, position, or
    posture and asking “does this make sense to me?”
  - *StressTolerance*: Ability to cope win the anxiety inherent in
    confronting the new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, and obscure
    events.

##### Negative Correlations with Years of Experience

  - *Assessment*: focus on self-evaluation and “doing the right thing.”
  - *DeprivationSensitivity*: Seeking information to escape the tension
    of not knowing something. Intellectually engaged to think about
    abstract or complex ideas and solve problems.

## Self-Efficacy Correlations

##### Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity and Non-cybersecurity respondents rated self-efficacy for “the level of knowledge” and “the ability” to work in the cybersecurity field". Several personality dimensions display moderate positive correlations.

##### Cybersecurity Professionals: Self-Confidence and Need for Cognition correlated highest

##### Non-cybersecurity Professionals: Joyous Exploration and Stress Tolerance correlated highest

## K Means Clustering I (Curiosity Dimensions)

##### Personality clustering results from respondent data for Curiosity (5 personality dimensions). The chart below is faceted into four clusters generally described by Kashdan et al. as:

##### Cluster 1: “Empathizers” (29%)

##### Cluster 2: “Fascinated” (26%)

##### Cluster 3: “Problem Solvers” (25%)

##### Cluster 4: “Avoiders” (20%)

##### Read a description of these clusters on pages 13-14 of the following published article:

## K Means Clustering II (All Personality Dimensions)

##### Personality clustering results faceted based on variability in mean scores among the clusters (dimensions with high variability vs. dimensions with low variability).

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

##### The largest cluster, *Cluster 2* (43%), generally reports high scores across all the dimensions and appears to resemble “Problem Solvers” and “Fascinated” personality profiles.

##### *Cluster 1* (27%) and *Cluster 3* (29%) , consists of respondents with lower scores on many dimensions and resemble “Avoiders” and “Empathizers”, respectively.

##### Low variability was observed between personality clusters in many dimensions.

## Correlation Analysis of Personality Dimensions

##### Correlation coefficients are displayed and shaded. Green boxes are drawn from the results of hierarchical clustering of these personality dimensions. For example, respondent data suggests “Search for Knowledge” and “Joyous Exploration” measure the same trait.
