### Personality Trait Raw Scores

###### Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity professionals are displayed in the **green** boxplots. Boxplots graphically depict numerical data through their quartiles. Boxplots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution. The median value is labeled in **red** text. Outliers are plotted as black dots.

###### T Scores are used to display results in comparison to a reference. A T Score of 50 represents the population average, with 40 and 60 representing one standard deviation higher and lower than the population, respectively. These T Scores were based on results published in peer reviewed literature noted in the references and data available from the Eugene-Springfield Community Sample at <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ESCS-Data>.

##### The definition of each dimension, in order of their scores among cybersecurity professionals, is as follows:

  - *StressTolerance*: Ability to cope win the anxiety inherent in
    confronting the new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, and obscure
    events.
  - *Locomotion*: decisiveness, task orentiation, intrinsic motivation
    to get the job done.
  - *JoyousExploration*: Preference for new information and experiences,
    and the valuing of self-expansion over security.
  - *Non-Conformity*: refusal to conform to prevailing rules or
    practices.
  - *DeprivationSensitivity*: Seeking information to escape the tension
    of not knowing something. Intellectually engaged to think about
    abstract or complex ideas and solve problems.
  - *Adaptability*: ability to adjust to new conditions.
  - *ThrillSeeking*: On the hunt for varied, novel, complex, and intense
    experiences and ready to risk physical, social, and financial
    safety.
  - *Need for Cognition*: engage and enjoy effortful cognitive
    endeavors.
  - *SocialCuriosity*: Desire to know what other people are thinking and
    doing through overt means (observing and probing questions) or
    covert means (listening into conversations or gathering second-hand
    information).
  - *Professional Skepticism*: Characteristic of withholding a
    conclusion on a matter until sufficient evidence to form a basis for
    a reasonable conclusion has been obtained; Taking a step back from
    an issue, position, or posture and asking “does this make sense to
    me?”; Attitude to look below the surface and see if the numbers,
    situation, factors or people look out of place; Ability to ask
    questions beyond the obvious answer; Not placing inappropriate
    degree of trust in people, processes, controls and data; Someone who
    would be unafraid to pursue a resolution when he/she uncovers a
    questionable activity.
  - *Assessment*: focus on self-evaluation and “doing the right thing.”
  - *Grit*: perseverance and passion for long-term goals.

### Personality Traits and Years of Experience. Several moderate correlations between Years of Experience and Behavioral Traits were observed in the data. Experience correlated positively with Self-Efficacy, Self-Confidence, Self-Determining, and Stress Tolerance. Experience correlated negatively with Deprivation Sensitivity and Assessment.

\#\#\#\#\#\# Positive Correlations with Experience \* *Self-Efficacy*:
belief in one’s own ability to deal with a prospective situation in
cybersecurity roles. \* *SelfConfidence*: Someone who would be unafraid
to pursue a resolution when he/she uncovers a questionable activity. \*
*SelfDetermining*: Taking a step back from an issue, position, or
posture and asking “does this make sense to me?” \* *StressTolerance*:
Ability to cope win the anxiety inherent in confronting the new,
unexpected, complex, mysterious, and obscure events.

###### Negative Correlations with Experience

  - *Assessment*: focus on self-evaluation and “doing the right thing.”
  - *DeprivationSensitivity*: Seeking information to escape the tension
    of not knowing something. Intellectually engaged to think about
    abstract or complex ideas and solve problems.

### Self Efficacy Correlations

##### Self-Efficacy is belief in one’s own ability to deal with a prospective situation in cybersecurity roles.

### K Means Clustering

###### K means clustering identified three distinct clusters based on all respondant responses.

###### The largest cluster, *Cluster 2*, generally scored high across all the dimensions.

###### Cluster 1, consists of respondants with significantly lower scores on Stress Tolerance, Self Determining, Thrill Seeking and significantly higher Suspension of Judgement.

###### Cluster 3, consists of respondants with significantly lower scores on Social Curiosity, Interpersonal Understanding, Thrill Seeking, Deprivation Sensitivity, and Assessment.

###### Little variability was observed between personality clusters in the following dimensions: Non-Conformity, Search for Knowledge, Joyous Exploration, Questioning Mind, Locomotion, Adaptabiliy, Grit, Suspension of Judgement.
