Northrop Grumman CATTConV Survey Results
================

#### 63 Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity Professionals and 39 other Northrop Grumman Professionals (ex. Program Managers, Systems Engineers) participated in this data collection.

##### Research aims:

  - Identify personality traits that are common among Northrop Grumman’s
    Cybersecurity Professionals
  - Determine raw score distributions and density functions for 17
    personality dimensions; understand variability among cybersecurity
    workers
  - Verify factor analysis for 17 personality measures (i.e. degree
    individual questions are measuring the intended personality trait)
  - Identify potential components to a predictive model of latent talent
    for cybersecurity work roles
  - Refine the personality questionnaire

##### Results and analysis from this data collection will assist Northrop Grumman Project Work in support of the Army Research Institute and the Army’s Cyber Proponent.

##### The description of each personality dimension is at the bottom of this page. *NonConformity* appears to be least important in this sample and has limited variability around the center of this scale.

## Personality Traits and Experience Correlations

##### Data analysis determined several moderate correlations (0.3 - 0.5) between behavioral traits and years of experience.

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Positive Correlations with Years of Experience

  - *Self-Efficacy*: belief in one’s own ability to deal with a
    prospective situation in cybersecurity roles.
  - *SelfConfidence*: Someone who would be unafraid to pursue a
    resolution when he/she uncovers a questionable activity.
  - *SelfDetermining*: Taking a step back from an issue, position, or
    posture and asking “does this make sense to me?”
  - *StressTolerance*: Ability to cope win the anxiety inherent in
    confronting the new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, and obscure
    events.

##### Negative Correlations with Years of Experience

  - *Assessment*: focus on self-evaluation and “doing the right thing.”
  - *DeprivationSensitivity*: Seeking information to escape the tension
    of not knowing something. Intellectually engaged to think about
    abstract or complex ideas and solve problems.

## Self-Efficacy Correlations

##### Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity and Non-cybersecurity respondents rated self-efficacy for “the level of knowledge” and “the ability” to work in the cybersecurity field". Several personality dimensions display moderate positive correlations.

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Cybersecurity Professionals: Self-Confidence and Need for Cognition correlated highest

##### Non-cybersecurity Professionals: Joyous Exploration and Stress Tolerance correlated highest

## K Means Clustering (All Personality Dimensions)

##### Three personality clusters resulted from the respondent data. Highlighted in green are personality dimensions with greatest variability that serve as the defining features of the cluster.

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

##### The largest cluster, *Cluster 2* (43%), generally reports high scores across all the dimensions and appears to resemble “Problem Solvers” and “Fascinated” personality profiles.

##### *Cluster 1* (27%) and *Cluster 3* (29%) , consists of respondents with lower scores on many dimensions. Cluster 1 may best resemble “Avoiders” and and Cluster 3 “Empathizers”.

##### Read a description of Problem Solvers, Fascinated, Avoiders, and Empathizers on pages 14 of the following article:

## Correlation Analysis of Personality Dimensions

##### Correlation coefficients are displayed and shaded. Green boxes are drawn from the results of hierarchical clustering of these personality dimensions. For example, respondent data suggests “Search for Knowledge” and “Joyous Exploration” measure the same trait.
