## Personality Trait Boxplots

##### Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity professionals are displayed in the **green** boxplots.

##### Boxplots graphically depict numerical data through their quartiles. The median value is labeled in **red** text. Outliers are plotted as black dots.

##### T Scores are used to display results in comparison to a reference. A T Score of 50 represents the population average, with 40 and 60 representing one standard deviation higher and lower than the population, respectively.

##### These T Scores were based on results published in peer reviewed literature noted in the References and data available from the Eugene-Springfield Community Sample at <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ESCS-Data>.

## Self-Efficacy Correlations

##### Northrop Grumman Cybersecurity and non-cybersecurity Respondants rated Self-Efficacy (one’s own ability) for the knowledge and abilty to work in the cybersecurity field.

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Cybersecurity Professionals: Self-Confidence and Need for Cognition correlated highest

##### Non-cybersecurity Professionals: Joyous Exploration, Stress Tolerance, and Locomotion correlated highest

### K Means Clustering

##### K means clustering identified three distinct personality profiles based on survey responses. The chart below is faceted into two groups of personality dimensions based on deviation between clusters (high and low).

![](CATTCon_Personality_Dashboard_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

##### The largest cluster, *Cluster 1*, generally scored high across all the dimensions.

##### Cluster 2, consists of respondants with significantly lower scores on Stress Tolerance, Self Determining, Thrill Seeking and higher Suspension of Judgement.

##### Cluster 3, consists of respondants with significantly lower scores on Social Curiosity, Interpersonal Understanding, Thrill Seeking, Deprivation Sensitivity, and Assessment.

##### Little variability was observed between personality clusters in the following dimensions: Non-Conformity, Search for Knowledge, Joyous Exploration, Questioning Mind, Locomotion, Adaptabiliy, Grit, Suspension of Judgement.

## Correlation Analysis of the Questionnaire’s Personality Dimensions
